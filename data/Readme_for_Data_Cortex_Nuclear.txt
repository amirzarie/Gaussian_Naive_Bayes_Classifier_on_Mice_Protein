Protein expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the nuclear fraction of cortex from control and Down syndrome mice.


First column indicates mouse id. 
15 measurements were registered for each mouse.

Last four columns indicate: Genotype (control or trisomy), Treatment (memantine or saline), 
Behavior (context-shock (C/S) or shock-context (S/C)) 
and the class of mice according to the three features (c-CS-s, c-CS-m, c-SC-s, c-SC-m, c-SC-s, t-CS-s, t-CS-m, t-SC-s, t-SC-m, t-SC-s ).
